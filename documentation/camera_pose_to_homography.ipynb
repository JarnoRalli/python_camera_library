    "# Camera Pose to Homography Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to convert camera pose information, defined in a world coordinate system, into a homography mapping. The mapping relates a defined plane in the world coordinate system to the camera plane. We begin by explaining how to define a homography mapping for a plane aligned with the world coordinate system. Then, we address a more general case where the world coordinate frame and the plane of interest are not aligned. The motivation for the second case is as follows: imagine you need to map points between the camera plane and a plane defined in the world coordinate frame. However, this plane may not necessarily align with the world coordinate system. Such a mapping enables determining the 3D coordinates, within the plane, of a point observed in the camera."
