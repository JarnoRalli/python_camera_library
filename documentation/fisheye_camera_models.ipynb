    "# 1 Spherical Camera Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping functions of equisolid angle, equidistant, and stereographic fish-eye lenses can be described using a sphere. Each type of lens employs a distinct projection mechanism to capture wide or panoramic views, often up to 180 degrees or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Equidistant Lenses**: These lenses maintain distances on the image plane proportional to the actual angular distance from the optical axis, without compressing or expanding the distance as the angle increases. This characteristic makes them particularly useful for angular measurements.\n",
    "* **Equisolid Angle Lenses**: These lenses use an equi-solid (or equal area) projection, which aims to map equal areas on the sphere to equal areas on the plane. The mapping function for equisolid angle lenses involves a specific mathematical relationship where the angle of incidence in the object space is related to the radial distance on the image plane. This relationship ensures that areas are preserved proportionally, making these lenses suitable for applications where such proportional representation is crucial.\n",
    "* **Stereographic Lenses**: These lenses use a stereographic projection mechanism, where points on a sphere are projected onto a plane from one of the sphere's poles. This type of projection results in images with less distortion towards the edges, providing a more natural representation of scenes, especially for photographic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, each lens type (equisolid angle, equidistant, and stereographic) employs a unique projection method to capture wide views, with differences in how they manage distortion and preserve image properties like angles and areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe a point on the sphere's surface, we use three coordinates: $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, representing the radial distance, the zenith direction and the azimuth angle. Imagine this setup as depicted in a Figure 1 showing the spherical model, where each point on the sphere is mapped to a point in the lens's view.\n",
